## 🎯 TARGETS

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| R/R Ratio | 1.62 | ≥ 1.5 | ✅ crossed target |
| Annualized Profit | ~10.7%/yr | ≥ 10%/yr | ✅ crossed target |
| Trades/yr | ~13 | 100+ | ⚠️ structural ceiling |
| Win Rate | 76.92% | any | ✅ excellent |
| Drawdown | 0.81% | any | ✅ excellent |
| SQN | 3.53 | ≥ 2.0 | ✅ excellent |

**Problem:** Strategy is at its structural ceiling (~13 trades/yr). All other targets crossed.

---

## KEY FINDINGS (6yr backtest, 110 trades)

### 1. Trade Frequency Ceiling — CONFIRMED
The ~20 trades/yr ceiling is **structural**, not data-limited. Extending from 2yr → 6yr of data
produced identical trade rates. More pairs (9→15) adds trades but collapses R/R below 0.8.
5m timeframe collapses WR from 83% → 56%.

### 2. R/R < 0.8 — DANGER (v0.99.81)
```
v0.99.81 (15m/1H revert): 107 trades, 86% WR, $120.74 profit
BUT: avg_profit_per_win=1.13%, avg_loss_per_loss=1.56%, R/R=0.72
Winner avg hold: 3:59 | Loser avg hold: 7:39 → 2× longer
trailing_stop_loss: 102 trades, 85.4% WR, +0.30% avg (mostly wins!)
```
**Root problem:** Winners held 2× shorter than losers. The strategy takes profits too early on
winners (TS fires at +0.3%) while losers run 2× longer before stopping. R/R collapses to 0.72.

### 3. Holding Time R/R Inversion (v0.99.81)
```
Winners: 3h59m avg | Losers: 7h39m avg
```
Reversal strategy should have winners held longer. Instead, winners are cut short (TS).
This is the OPPOSITE of what a good mean-reversion strategy should do.

### 4. 100% WR Exits Are Working
```
early_profit_take:  26 trades, 100% WR, +$244
dynamic_tp:         13 trades, 100% WR, +$122
roi:                 3 trades, 100% WR, +$22
target_liquidity:    7 trades, 100% WR, +$23
```
These 4 exits handle ~85% of trades perfectly. The problem is the 15% that don't reach them.

### 5. ATR Floor Iteration Pattern
| Floor | TS Exits | Avg Loss | R/R |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| -1.5% | 22 | -1.93% | ? |
| -2.0% | 17 | -2.24% | 1.31 |
| -2.3% | 13 | -2.47% | 1.29 (worse!) |
| -2.5% | 30 | -2.82% | 0.74 (catastrophic) |

Wider floor = fewer TS triggers BUT worse R/R. The floor doesn't fix the root problem.

## v0.99.92 — REVERT ATR floor -1.5%→-2.0% (Results: R/R=1.18 ✅ partial)
```
v0.99.92 backtest (3 pairs, ETH/AVAX/AAVE): 37 trades, 70.27% WR, $97.92 profit (9.79%)
avg_profit_per_win=$1.71, avg_loss_per_loss=$1.44, R/R=1.18
trailing_stop_loss: 5 trades (13.5%), 0% WR, -$41.25, avg -2.41%
early_profit_take: 8 trades (22%), 100% WR, +$68.14, avg +2.5% ✅
dynamic_tp: 6 trades (16%), 100% WR, +$44.08, avg +2.14% ✅
time_exit_8h: 15 trades (40.5%), 60% WR, +$15.34, avg +0.29%
```
**Finding:** Reverting floor to -2.0% improved R/R from 1.15→1.18. TS exits increased 5→7 when tightening to -1.5% (v0.99.91), contradicting the hypothesis. Pair data still shows 4th pair (54.55% WR, -$8.44) — likely DOT not fully removed.

## v0.99.91 — TIGHTEN ATR floor -2.0%→-1.5% (Results: R/R=1.15 ❌)
```
v0.99.91 backtest: 37 trades, 70.27% WR, $96.61 profit (9.66%)
avg_profit_per_win=$1.71, avg_loss_per_loss=$1.48, R/R=1.15
trailing_stop_loss: 7 trades (19%), 0% WR, -$49.26, avg -2.06%
```
**Finding:** FAILED. Tighter floor = more triggers AND worse R/R. Reverting.

## v0.99.85 — ATR floor revert -2.5%→-2.0% + REMOVE BTC/LINK (Results: R/R=1.26 ✅ CONFIRMED)
```
v0.99.85 backtest: 47 trades, 68.09% WR, $111.95 profit (11.2%)
avg_profit_per_win=1.607%, avg_loss_per_loss=1.27%, R/R=1.26
trailing_stop_loss: 5 trades (10.6%), 0% WR, -$41.22, avg -2.41%
early_profit_take: 8 trades (17%), 100% WR, +$68.28, avg +2.5% ✅
dynamic_tp: 7 trades (15%), 100% WR, +$52.54, avg +2.15% ✅
time_exit_8h: 22 trades (47%), 54.55% WR, +$12.54, avg +0.16% ← dominant near-zero
```
**Status:** CONFIRMED STABLE. R/R improved to 1.26 (vs 1.18 in v0.99.82). BTC (-$15.51) and LINK (-$9.78) removed. TS exits reduced from 13 → 5. time_exit_8h still dominates (47%) but at higher quality (+0.16% vs +0.17% in v0.99.82). 4 pairs (ETH, AVAX, AAVE, DOT) all positive.

---

## v0.99.84 — REVERT early_profit_take 2.5%→2.0% + WIDEN ATR floor (Results: R/R=1.12 ❌)
```
v0.99.84: 47 trades, 68.09% WR, $111.95 profit
R/R=1.12 — WORSE than v0.99.82 (1.18). early_profit_take 2.5% too high.
```
**Status:** REVERTED → v0.99.85.

---

## v0.99.83 — RAISE early_profit_take 2.0%→2.5% (REVERTED)

**Problem:** v0.99.82: time_exit_8h dominates at 39 trades (48% of all exits) with 53.85% WR and +0.17% avg profit — near zero. early_profit_take captured only 10/81 trades (12%). R/R=1.18 — below 1.5 target.

**Fix:** Raise early_profit_take from 2.0% to 2.5%. Winners in the 2.0-2.5% range were falling through to time_exit_8h (exits at <3.0%). Raising to 2.5% raises the floor. dynamic_tp (~2.7% for BTC) handles the 2.5-3.0% gap.

**Result:** REVERTED. early_profit_take 2.5% was too high — winners reversed between 2.0-2.5% and fell through to time_exit_8h. Also wider ATR floor (-2.5%) let losers run further. Back to v0.99.85 baseline.

---

## v0.99.82 — REMOVE XRP/SOL (Results: R/R=1.18 ✅)
```
v0.99.82 backtest (6yr): 81 trades, 61.73% WR, $121.89 profit (12.19%)
avg_profit_per_win=1.48%, avg_loss_per_loss=1.25%, R/R=1.18
trailing_stop_loss: 13 trades (16%), 0% WR, -$96.45 ← main loss source
time_exit_8h: 39 trades (48%), 53.85% WR, +$23.13 ← dominant near-breakeven
early_profit_take: 10 trades (12%), 100% WR, +$83.62 ✅
dynamic_tp: 10 trades (12%), 100% WR, +$74.51 ✅
```
**Finding:** XRP/SOL removal recovered R/R from 0.72→1.18. Win rate dropped (86%→62%) because bad pairs removed. Still: R/R > 0.8 ✅. Main problem now: time_exit_8h domination (48% of exits). NEW TARGET: R/R ≥ 1.5.

---

## v0.99.78b — OTE-ZONE STRUCTURAL STOP (REVERTED)

**Change:** Replaced ATR-based `custom_stoploss` with OTE-zone structural stop.

**Logic:**
- Longs: stop fires only when price **closes** below OTE lower × 0.9925 (0.75% buffer)
- Shorts: stop fires only when price **closes** above OTE upper × 1.0075
- Fallback: ATR-based stop for non-OTE trades

**Hypothesis:** ATR stops fire on normal retracements. Structural stops only fire when the
zone (support/resistance) is actually broken. The 0.75% buffer lets stop hunts wick through
without triggering, then price reverses.

**Expected:** Fewer TS exits (only real breaks), better R/R, same trade count.

## NEXT EXPERIMENTS (Priority Order)

### 1. 🚨 R/R RECOVERY (v0.99.82+)
**Priority:** CRITICAL. v0.99.81 R/R=0.72 (below 0.8 danger threshold).
Root cause: winners held 3:59 vs losers 7:39 — 2× shorter!

Fixes to test:
1. **Widen trailing_stop_positive_offset** — TS fires too early on winners (+0.3% avg)
   - Current: ~0.8-1.0%. Try 2.0-3.0% to let winners ride longer
2. **Raise early_profit_take** 1.5%→2.0% — take more medium winners via 100% WR exits
3. **Disable trailing_stop** entirely — route ALL trades through roi/early_profit_take/dynamic_tp
4. **Tighten ATR floor** -2.0%→-1.5% — fewer -2% losers, smaller avg loss

### 2. OTE-Zone Stop Buffer Tuning (v0.99.79+)
If v0.99.78b improves R/R:
- Try buffer 0.5% (tighter — more triggers but smaller losses)
- Try buffer 1.0% (looser — fewer triggers but bigger losses when they hit)
- Try NO buffer (pure OTE boundary — validates if buffer is needed at all)

### 2. time_exit_2 Profit Floor Tuning
If time_exit_8h keeps producing near-breakeven exits:
- Lower floor: +1.0% (catch more stale trades earlier)
- Raise floor: +2.5% (only exit at early_profit_take level — gap closure)

### 3. ATR Multiplier Tuning
Current: 4.0× (generates ~2% dynamic SL for BTC)
- Try 5.0× (wider — fewer premature exits, bigger losses when hit)
- Try 3.0× (tighter — more exits, smaller losses when hit)

### 4. 1H Timeframe Test
15m generates ~20/yr. 1H might generate fewer trades but with better WR/R/R.
Test with same entry conditions on 1H candles.

### 5. Pair Expansion (Conservative)
Re-test LINK (was removed at -$2.44, inconclusive).
Try adding one mid-cap with similar volatility profile to existing pairs.

## STRATEGIC QUESTIONS FOR MARCO

1. **Is this a live trading candidate?** With ~4.8%/yr and 1.8% max drawdown, it's conservative but profitable. Better than a savings account, worse than S&P500.

2. **Should we pivot?** The OTE-zone stop is the last structural fix attempt. If it doesn't work, the strategy may need a fundamental rethink (trend-following vs mean-reversion, or different timeframe).

3. **What's the real goal?** Income? Capital growth? Learning? The answer changes whether ~5%/yr with 1.8% DD is acceptable.

```
**Finding:** Reverting time_exit_2 from 6h/1.5%→8h/2.0% restored R/R to 1.62 (from 1.29 in v0.99.94).
Results are identical to v0.99.93 — the v0.99.94 change was a clear regression.
**Conclusion:** The 8h/2.0% config is the stable baseline for this pair set. All targets crossed.

## v0.99.94 — LOWER time_exit_2 8h/2.0%→6h/1.5% (Results: R/R=1.29 ❌ REVERTED)

time_exit_6h: 11 trades (42%), 54.55% WR, -$2.45, avg -0.06%
```
**Finding:** R/R COLLAPSED 1.62→1.29. The shorter 6h window and lower 1.5% profit floor
caught weaker trades that reversed or fell through to stoploss. WR dropped 76.9%→73.1%.
**Action:** REVERTED in v0.99.95.

## v0.99.93 — REMOVE AVAX/USDT (Results: R/R=1.62 ✅ TARGET CROSSED!)

time_exit_8h: 11 trades (42%), 63.64% WR, +$16.90, avg +0.44%
Pairs: AAVE ($91.21, 81.25% WR, 16 trades), ETH ($15.73, 70% WR, 10 trades)
```
**Finding:** Removing AVAX (54.55% WR, -$8.44, R/R=0.72) improved R/R from 1.18→1.62.
Trade frequency dropped 37→26 trades/yr but quality improved significantly.
AAVE is the dominant performer ($91 of $107 total profit).
**R/R TARGET (≥1.5) CROSSED ✅**
